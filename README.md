#Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The company wanted to help students prepare for and schedule their driving lessons and tests. They wanted me to help them make a system that could handle secure user registration, lesson scheduling, progress tracking, and instructor assignment, all while maintaining strong data protection through HTTPS and secure coding practices. 

#What did you do particularly well?

I felt i did paticually well in my projects was creating uml diagrams that represents the steps in which the process needs to take to get to the next step. 

#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If i could revise one of my works it would be the power point i made for the project. I would provide more detail and make it a bit longer. 

#How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user's needs by focusing on simplicity, security, and usability. By reviewing the project requirements and aligning them with industry best practices, I ensured the system met both functional and security-related expectations. Considering the user's needs is essential because it helps create software that is not only functional, but also usable, safe, and aligned with real-world goals. 

#How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

It is important to use things like uml diagrams and flowcharts. So that is what I would use to get started. I would also prioritize secure coding, modular design, and testability from the start. I would also check back in with stakeholders frequently.
